-> examplex for scripts that can induce some kind of chaos

the plan is to use the transparent functionality of mitmproxy and install it as a daemonset on all nodes.
then the target containers have to be configured to have http and https proxy over mitmproxy-pod on their node.
if https is used, certificates have to be installed on the target container, otherwise it will not trust the proxy.
this could be done via configmap.
